1 ordinary year has 1 odd day
Explanation :  In an ordinary year, there are 365 days, which means 52 x 7 + 1, or 52 weeks and one day. This additional day is called an odd day.
1 leap year has 2 odd days
Explanation:  A leap year has 366 days. There are 29 days in February in a leap year. There are 52 weeks and 2 odd days in a leap year.

If the year is evenly divisible by 4, 
If the year is evenly divisible by 100, 
If the year is evenly divisible by 400, 
```The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).```
If the year is not evenly divisible by 400, 
```The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).```





Counting of odd days:

1 customary year = 365 days (52 weeks+ 1 day)
∴ 1 customary year has 1 odd day.

1 jump year =366 days = (52 weeks+2 days)
∴ 1 jump year has 2 odd days.

100 year =76 normal year +24 jump year
= (76*1+24*2) odd days =124 odd days
= (17 weeks +5 days) =5 odd days.
No. of odd days in 200 years = (5*2) =3 odd days.

No. of odd days in 300 years = (5*3) =1 odd day.

No. of odd days in 400 years= (5*4+1) = 0 odd days.

Every one of 800 years, 1200 years, 1600 years, 2000 years and so on has 0 odd days.
```
February: 28 days(ordinary year) gives '0' odd days, 29 days (leap year) gives '1' odd day.

Jan, March, May, July, Aug, Oct and Dec have 31 days each and therefore give '3' odd days.

April, June, Sep and Nov each have 30 days and therefore give '2' odd days.
```
Last day of a century cannot be Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday because of the number of odd days.

## Which year will have the same calendar as that of the year 2007?

 Count the number of odd days from the year 2007 onwards to get the sum equal to 0 odd day.

Year	             2007	 2008	 2009	2010	2011	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016	2017
Number of Odd days  1	    2	     1	  1	    1	   2	   1	   1	   1	    2	    1
Sum = 14 odd days = 0 odd days

Therefore, calendar of the year 2018 will have the same calendar as that of the year 2007.
