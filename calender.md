# calender
The calendar starts on 1st January and ends on 31st December.  The year is classified into two types:
ordinary years (365 days)
Leap year (366 days).
In an ordinary year, there are 365 days, which means 52 x 7 + 1, or 52 weeks and one day.
  Days	                 Sunday	     Monday	   Tuesday	   Wednesday	 Thursday	  Friday	  Saturday
Number of odd days	       0	         1	        2	           3	        4	         5	       6
Counting of odd days:

1 customary year = 365 days (52 weeks+ 1 day)
∴ 1 customary year has 1 odd day.

1 jump year =366 days = (52 weeks+2 days)
∴ 1 jump year has 2 odd days.

100 year =76 normal year +24 jump year
= (76*1+24*2) odd days =124 odd days
= (17 weeks +5 days) =5 odd days.
No. of odd days in 200 years = (5*2) =3 odd days.

No. of odd days in 300 years = (5*3) =1 odd day.

No. of odd days in 400 years= (5*4+1) = 0 odd days.

Every one of 800 years, 1200 years, 1600 years, 2000 years and so on has 0 odd days.
